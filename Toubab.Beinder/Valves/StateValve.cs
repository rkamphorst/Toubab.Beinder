    /// State-bearing bindables are properties.
    /// 
    /// Properties have a state, and can produce events when their value changes.
    /// 
    /// Properties can also consume those events from other properties,
    /// for example by setting this property to the changed value announced
    /// by the other propety.
    /// 
    /// The difference between the <see cref="StateValve"/> and the <see cref="BroadcastValve"/>
    /// is that (a) consumed events result in a state change, and (b) not every consumed event
    /// has effect: *only* if it may cause a state change, an event from one of the bindables
    /// in the valve is propagated to the other bindables in the valve.
